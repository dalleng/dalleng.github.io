# My first post: trying out Hugo

I have chosen Hugo because of how popular this open source tool is. I have seen it has plenty of themes and plugins. I hope to keep using it for a very long time.
Foo bar jaz.

```python
def hello_hugo():
    print("hello hugo")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    hello_hugo()
```
